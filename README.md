## Overview

Current [muting feature of Twitter](https://help.twitter.com/en/using-twitter/advanced-twitter-mute-options) allows users to filter tweets **based on words and hashtags**.

But users do not want to mute words or hashtags, they want to mute **specific topics, behaviors, and misinformation**.

We have created a tool to achieve this with the current state of the art in machine learning applied to NLP.

## Installation

Our project has 3 repositories:

1. [Frontend](https://github.com/PotatoSpudowski/Ribitter-web) an incredible Twitter clone web to showcase our advancements.
2. [Muting Service](https://github.com/PotatoSpudowski/Elixr), tweets filter service based on user preferences and topic subtraction.
3. [Missinformation Service](https://github.com/PotatoSpudowski/MisMatch), checking misinformation service.

You will need to run these 3 repositories.

Installation instructions are available on the README of each one of them.
