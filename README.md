Overpowering Twitter muting feature to improve Twitter users exprience. 


## Overview
Current [muting feature of twitter](https://help.twitter.com/en/using-twitter/advanced-twitter-mute-options) allows users filter tweets **based on words and hashtag**.

But users do not want to mute words or hasgtags, they want to mute **specific topics, behaviors and missinformation**.

We have created a tool to achieve this with current state of the art in machine learning applied to NLP.


## Installation

Our project have 3 repositories:

1. [Frontend](https://github.com/PotatoSpudowski/Ribitter-web) an incredible twitter clone web to showcase our advancements.
2. [Muting Service](https://github.com/PotatoSpudowski/Elixr), tweets filter service based on user preferences and topic substraction.
3. [Missinformation Service](https://github.com/PotatoSpudowski/MisMatch), checking missinformation service.

You will need to run these 3 repositories.

Installation instructions are available on the README of each one of them.
